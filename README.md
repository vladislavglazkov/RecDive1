# RecDive1

LIMITATIONS:
- NOT ALL EXCEPTION CHECKS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED
- NO INTERRUPTION UPON EXCEEDING MAXIMUM RECURSION DEPTH (TO BE ADDED)

REMARKS:
- Entry point should be the static method
- CodeLoad.cs:193 should contain actual path to the folder with all the liraries required for client code. The subsequent lines should explicitly connect those libraries (minimum requirement: mscorlib.dll, System.dll)
